			<h1>Banks seek deferred tax assets clarity</h1><br><br>


Mumbai: Banks that are looking to move to the new tax regime will have to write off or reinstate deferred tax assets (DTAs). Banks with huge DTAs on their books have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to synchronise its provisioning norms with the recently-announced tax rates. Banks are hoping RBI prescribes a methodology so they can write these off over next three to five years. Banks fear that reinstating DTAs at one go could impact their net worth, or even earnings per share (EPS). The problem is especially acute for banks and NBFCs that have high non-performing assets (NPA) or stressed loans. At present, every bank has to provide or provision for stressed loans. However, for taxation, a different percentage for the same loans is prescribed. This creates a mismatch wherein many banks get a balance DTA on the asset side. “Banks with huge NPAs on their books will have to provide for that. It would lead to an accounting hit. Tax is computed in a particular manner based on actual write-offs and notional deductions linked to rural earnings. There is mismatch between the two and the same needs to be synchronised. This leads to deferred tax treatment, which will be impacted due to fall in rates,” said Girish Vanvari, founder, tax advisory Transaction Square. Banks may have to reinstate these assets to move to the new regime and that could hit their net worth, industry experts said. Currently, there is a question mark on the benefit of carrying forward of tax credits and it may not be available under new tax slabs announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, tax experts said.

<h2>Behind India’s rise as the no. 1 Test team is a collective force of bowlers, both spin and pace</h2><br><br>

Ahead of the first Test in Visakhapatnam, there was anticipation as to what sort of pitches India would roll out for this series against South Africa. There was a reason, for 2015 was still being talked about. Two matches on, and a comprehensive 2-0 (in India’s favour) later, any chatter about pitches is simply irrelevant. Given how Visakhapatnam and Pune pitches turned out, no traveling team can have complaints whatsoever. They were true-blue Indian pitches — slow turn in the first Test and hard-rolled batting wicket in second, with some grip for spinners on day four. And the fact that South Africa got completely outplayed was not down to any one of many factors like tosses, pitches, poor shot selection or simple inexperience Even if the Proteas had come to par in all of those aspects, this Indian team would still have made it 2-0. When playing at home, there is certain inevitability about Virat Kohli’s side. The batsmen will get runs on the board, even if they are one short. And the bowlers will get those 20 wickets, whether by spin or pace, or a combination of both.
 It is the underlying point emanating from this series win over South Africa. Kuldeep Yadav, proclaimed by Indian coach Ravi Shastri as their number one Test spinner in February, didn’t get a game. The uniquely gifted Jasprit Bumrah is out injured. And yet, India’s bowling might in this series seemed unconquerable, picking all 80 wickets on offer without any bother.

<h2>French media take Google to competition regulator over copyright</h2><br><br>

PARIS: French media said Thursday they would report Google to the country's competition regulator over its refusal to pay news companies for displaying their content in defiance of a strict new EU copyright law.

International news agency Agence France-Presse, which is not a member of the alliance, said it was preparing a separate complaint.
